# AdventureGame
Point and click adventure game programmed in Lua with the LÖVE 2D framework.

The goal of this project is to develop a 2D adventure game completely from scratch, including the engine of the game, the
assets used, etc. The development is currently still at a very early stage, and consists more in a prototype than an actual 
game.

## How to run the game

To run the game, you will need to install the [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org/) game engine on your machine. Then, simply download this repository
and launch the game by executing the following command : 

```bash
love path_to_repository_root
```

## Resources

As mentioned above, the game is programmed in Lua with the LÖVE 2D framework. It also makes use of the following libraries :
- [Classic](https://github.com/rxi/classic/) for object oriented programming in Lua.
- [Gamera](https://github.com/kikito/gamera) for the camera system.
- [Sodapop](https://github.com/tesselode/sodapop) for animations.
- [Shädows](https://github.com/matiasah/shadows) for the lighting engine.

The code for pathfinding in the game's engine was largely inspired by and adapted from user [MicUurloon's](https://github.com/MicUurloon)
code in his [AdventurePathfinding](https://github.com/MicUurloon/AdventurePathfinding) repository. 

## Assets

The example assets provided in the "assets" folder of this repository were drawn by **Vivvian**, the artist working with me
on the project.
